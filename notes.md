The 2014 scrape downloaded 18601 listings. 

Assuming 50 listings a listing page, there should be ~64K listings, because there are 1283 listing pages.

Also, of those 18601 listings, 14699 lack pictures, and 3632 have them. Those that have pictures have slightly different html than those who don't, which complicates parsing. Curiously, 3 listings have neither, of which 1 is the 'complete' dummy file.
